# Figment
This is my final project in IAT 167. This project was made using Processing. <br><br>

I have created a tile based game where the player must navigate the game world and advance through 
the 3 levels and 1 boss level in order to complete the game. In each level there is a key which must 
be used to open the door to the next level. In some levels that key is behind a locked gate which only 
opens once the player defeats all the enemies in the that level. <br>

Note: all the graphics in the game were created by me<br>
